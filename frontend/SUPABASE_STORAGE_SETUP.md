# Supabase Storage Setup for Profile Photos

## Issue Fixed: CORS Error with Firebase Storage

The profile photo upload was failing because you're using **Supabase** for storage, not Firebase Storage. I've updated the implementation to use Supabase instead.

## ✅ **What I Fixed**

1. **Updated userSettingsService.ts** to use Supabase Storage
2. **Updated test utility** to test Supabase instead of Firebase
3. **Added proper error handling** and fallback mechanisms
4. **Updated UI** to reflect Supabase usage

## 🔧 **Supabase Storage Setup Required**

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: `waqzavsbpqylztbcgctn`
3. **Go to Storage** in the left sidebar
4. **Create a new bucket**:
   - **Name**: `profile-photos`
   - **Public**: ✅ (checked)
   - **File size limit**: 50MB (or your preference)
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/*`

### Step 2: Set Storage Policies

1. **Go to Storage → Policies**
2. **Create policies for the `profile-photos` bucket**:

#### Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload profile photos" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'profile-photos' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

#### Policy 2: Allow public read access
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to profile photos" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'profile-photos');
```

#### Policy 3: Allow users to delete their own photos
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to delete their own profile photos" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'profile-photos' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

### Step 3: Alternative - Simple Policy (For Development)

If the above policies are too complex, you can use this simpler policy for development:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users full access" ON storage.objects
FOR ALL USING (bucket_id = 'profile-photos' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Setup**

1. **Click "Test Supabase Connection"** button on the User Settings page
2. **Check browser console** for detailed logs
3. **Try uploading a photo** - should work now!

## 📁 **File Structure in Supabase**

Photos will be stored with this structure:
```
profile-photos/
├── {userId}/
│   ├── 1757141017781-ABC.png
│   ├── 1757141023456-DEF.jpg
│   └── ...
```

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

1. **User selects photo** → Frontend validates file
2. **Upload to Supabase** → Uses Supabase Storage API
3. **Get public URL** → Supabase returns public URL
4. **Update Firebase Auth** → Profile photo URL updated
5. **Update backend DB** → Photo URL stored in database
6. **Success!** → Photo displays immediately

## 🛡️ **Fallback Mechanism**

If Supabase upload fails:
- **Converts image to base64**
- **Stores base64 data** in Firebase Auth and backend
- **Still works** but uses more storage space

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### Issue 1: "Bucket not found"
- **Solution**: Create the `profile-photos` bucket in Supabase

### Issue 2: "Permission denied"
- **Solution**: Check storage policies are set correctly

### Issue 3: "CORS error"
- **Solution**: Supabase handles CORS automatically, check policies

### Issue 4: "File too large"
- **Solution**: Check bucket file size limits

## 📋 **Checklist**

- [ ] Supabase project is active
- [ ] `profile-photos` bucket exists
- [ ] Storage policies are configured
- [ ] Bucket is public
- [ ] File size limits are appropriate
- [ ] Test button works
- [ ] Photo upload works
